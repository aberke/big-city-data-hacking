        <p id="placement-question">
          Is the placement of bike-share docks equitable?
        </p>
        <p>The map explores this question visually.</p>

        <p>
          It displays the progressive placement of bike-share docking stations
          over time, along with the race and median income of residents in the
          areas they serve.
        </p>

        <p>
          The map shows the addition of the docks, as well as the changes in
          income and race throughout the years the bike-share program has been
          in service. You can toggle the display to see only income, or race, or
          bikes data, or any of their combinations.
        </p>

        <br />

        <h2>About The Data</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Income and race data</strong> is provided for each year by
          census tract. It is from the
          <a
            href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/estimates.html"
            >American Community Survey (5-year)</a
          >, which provides yearly population estimates.
        </p>

        <p>
          The data used for this map is household median income, and household
          race. <br />*Race is displayed on the map as “Percent White”, which is
          calculated as the percentage of households that report “white only” in
          a given census tract.
        </p>

        <p>
          As of August 2019, this race and income data is
          <a
            href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/news/data-releases/2018/release.html"
            >only available up to 2017</a
          >, so the map shows the same 2017 data for years 2018 and 2019.
          <br />Margins of error and all of the processed data is available
          <a href="https://github.com/aberke/income-race-bikes/tree/master/data"
            >here.</a
          >
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Bike station location data</strong> is scraped from the
          bike-share company’s websites and is recent up to August 2019 (time of
          creation).
        </p>

        <p>

        <br />

        <p>
          The question of who bike-share systems serve and have the potential to
          better serve has been asked and answered before.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example,
          <a
            href="https://issuu.com/nycommunities4change/docs/final_citi_bike_report"
            >a 2019 report</a
          >
          found that New York’s Citi Bike system disproportionately serves New
          Yorkers of higher incomes and those who already have access to other
          transit options, and disproportionately serves few New Yorkers of
          color. <br />It reports a median household income of $90,400 in
          service areas versus $54,700 outside service areas. It also found that
          the Citi Bike service area was “twice as white” as the rest of the
          area.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yet U.S. studies have shown that people of color and people from the
          lowest-income households are in fact most likely to ride bicycles (<a
            href="https://peopleforbikes.org/blog/assumption-busters-surprising-facts-about-ethnicity-race-income-bicycles/"
            >sources</a
          >).
        </p>

        <p>
          This map explores data throughout the bike-share program years of
          service because while equitable placement of docks may be improving,
          future systems can aim to avoid patterns of servicing privileged
          neighborhoods first.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          Where to optimally place bike-share docks is a complex problem and
          different cities have various ways of sourcing new locations.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, the New York City department of transportation previously
          launched an online map to crowdsource suggestions, and there is a
          similar
          <a target="_blank" href="http://suggest.thehubway.com/page/about"
            >suggestion map</a
          >
          for Boston’s bike-share as well. However, a
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01944363.2018.1476174"
            >study published in the Journal of the American Planning
            Association</a
          >
          showed that only 5% of new docks placed in the 2014-2015 New York Citi
          Bike expansion were located within 100 feet of suggested locations.
          <br />This does not imply that the NYC’s DOT ignored the suggestions.
          Optimal dock locations depend on a variety of factors, such as
          proximity to other transit options, or the viability of removing
          parking or sidewalk space to make way for docks, as well as how
          additional docks will complement the placement of existing docks.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the Boston area, the Bluebikes bike-share system (previously
          Hubway) is owned by a partnership of multiple adjacent municipalities:
          Boston, Brookline, Cambridge, Somerville, and recently the city of
          Everett joined the partnership. The city of Cambridge actively
          welcomes businesses and property owners to sponsor the installation of
          docks near them, creating another mechanism to source the location of
          stations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Other dockless bike-share and scooter systems are entering the
          landscapes of these cities as well, such as
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.antbicycle.com/">Ant bicycles</a
          >, or
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.li.me/second-street/"
            >Lime scooters</a
          >. They may have the potential to reach the areas that city-owned
          bike-share systems have not, but
          <strong>they do not openly provide their data</strong> (as of 2019).
          <br />The companies that operate the city-owned bike-share systems
          such as those in New York (Citi bike) and Boston (Bluebike) are
          required by contract or
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=1687959&GUID=3FF09CCF-9E91-42C9-BC7E-FF1424902BB5"
            >local law</a
          >
          to compile and provide usage data. We can imagine cities compelling
          the other bike, scooter, and micromobility providers that operate
          within them to openly provide their data as well. This data would help
          city planners, traffic engineers, and researchers better understand
          the impacts and potential for these new mobility systems on our
          streets.
